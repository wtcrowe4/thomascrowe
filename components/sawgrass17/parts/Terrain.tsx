// Terrain -- displaced ground built from THREE pieces, because no single
// approach gives both smooth mounds and an exact shoreline:
//
//   1. RING   exact lake outline -> outward offset, earcut, flat at h=0.
//             Narrow ring between two dense polygons triangulates cleanly, so
//             the traced waterline stays pixel-accurate.
//   2. GRID   uniform lattice outside the ring, displaced by heightAt().
//             Uniform triangles are the whole point: the previous version
//             subdivided earcut output, whose slivers sheared under
//             displacement and produced garbage normals.
//   3. SKIRT  flat quads out to the old +/-100 extent. heightAt fades to 0
//             before the grid ends (GRID_FADE_END), so this joins with no step.
//
// The grid also gives usable world-space UVs, which ShapeGeometry never did --
// that is what unblocks a tiling turf albedo/normal.
//
